# SquadRangefinder

**SquadRangefinder** is a distance calculator for the game *Squad*. This tool utilizes landmarks on the map, such as markers for equipment or infantry, to calculate distances.

## How It Works

- Enlarge the map once using the `N` key to achieve the required scale for accurate calculations.
- Hold down `Alt` and left-click on your position and the landmark on the map.

- The calculated distance is then sent to a text-to-speech system to announce the distance in meters.
